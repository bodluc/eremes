Logaholic 3.0 Upgrade Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------- 

Quick Upgrade:
To upgrade from Logaholic 2.5 or greater, just overwrite all 
the files in your logaholic directory with the ones from 
this zip file. This upgrade method is irreversable!

Test Upgrade:
If you want to upgrade, but keep the option to go back to your old 
install, please do this:

1. Create a new directory for Logaholic 3.0 on your server and 
   upload the files (e.g. /logaholic3).

2. Create a copy of your logaholic database. To do this, just 
   copy the logaholic database folder in your mysql data directory 
   and save it as a different name (e.g. /logaholic3).

3. Open a browser to /logaholic3/install.php and follow the steps.
   Make sure you use the new database when prompted for the mysql 
   information.
